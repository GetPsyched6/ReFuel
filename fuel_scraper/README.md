## 🔧 Technical Details

### Why This Works

After testing multiple approaches, **Selenium with enhanced stealth** proved most effective:

1. **CDP (Chrome DevTools Protocol)** - Hides automation markers
2. **Navigator Property Masking** - Removes webdriver detection
3. **Human-like Behavior** - Realistic timing and scrolling
4. **Proper User Agent** - Mimics real Chrome browser

### What Didn't Work

- ❌ **Playwright**: Detected by UPS/FedEx
- ❌ **undetected-chromedriver**: Broken with Python 3.13
- ❌ **Basic requests**: Can't handle JavaScript-rendered content

### Stealth Configuration

```python
# Key techniques used:
- CDP user agent override
- Webdriver property hidden via JavaScript
- Automation flags disabled
- Gradual page scrolling (mimics human)
- Realistic wait times (5-10 seconds)
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Adjust Wait Times

Edit `scraper_selenium.py`:

```python
# For UPS (line ~80)
time.sleep(6)  # Increase if UPS fails

# For FedEx (line ~180)
time.sleep(10)  # Increase if FedEx fails

# For DHL (line ~280)
time.sleep(5)  # Usually reliable
```

### Enable Windowed Mode

Change line ~35:

```python
# Remove this line:
options.add_argument('--headless=new')

# Browser will be visible (useful for debugging)
```

---

## 📅 Automated Scheduling

### Cron Job (Linux/Mac)

```bash
# Edit crontab
crontab -e

# Add this line (runs every Monday at 6 AM):
0 6 * * 1 cd /Volumes/RochusSSD/GenAI/ReFuel/fuel_scraper && source venv/bin/activate && python scraper_selenium.py

# Or run weekly:
0 6 * * 0 cd /Volumes/RochusSSD/GenAI/ReFuel/fuel_scraper && source venv/bin/activate && python scraper_selenium.py
```

### Task Scheduler (Windows)

Create a batch file `run_scraper.bat`:

```batch
cd C:\path\to\fuel_scraper
call venv\Scripts\activate
python scraper_selenium.py
```

Schedule via Task Scheduler.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### No Data Scraped

**Check screenshots**:

- `ups_debug.png` or `ups_error.png`
- `fedex_debug.png` or `fedex_error.png`
- `dhl_error.png`

**Common fixes**:

1. Increase wait times (sites may be slow)
2. Check internet connection
3. Verify Chrome/ChromeDriver compatibility
4. Try running in windowed mode (remove headless flag)

### Chrome/ChromeDriver Issues

```bash
# Check if Chrome is installed
which google-chrome

# Selenium auto-manages ChromeDriver, but if issues persist:
pip install --upgrade selenium
```

### Module Not Found

```bash
# Reinstall dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### IP Blocked

If you run the scraper too frequently (multiple times per minute):

- Wait a few minutes
- Try from different network
- Add longer delays between runs

### Data Quality Checks

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load data
df = pd.read_csv('fuel_surcharge_combined_TIMESTAMP.csv')

# Check for completeness
print(f"Total rows: {len(df)}")
print(f"Carriers: {df['carrier'].unique()}")
print(f"Missing values: {df.isnull().sum()}")

# Validate price ranges
print(f"Price range: ${df['at_least_usd'].min()} - ${df['but_less_than_usd'].max()}")
```

---

## 🎓 Advanced Usage

### Import as Module

```python
from scraper_selenium import StealthFuelScraper

scraper = StealthFuelScraper()
scraper.scrape_all()
scraper.export_to_csv()

# Access raw data
ups_data = scraper.results['ups']
dhl_data = scraper.results['dhl']
```

### Custom Processing

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load and merge data
ups = pd.read_csv('fuel_surcharge_ups_*.csv')
dhl = pd.read_csv('fuel_surcharge_dhl_*.csv')

# Combine and analyze
combined = pd.concat([ups, dhl])
avg_surcharge = combined['surcharge'].str.rstrip('%').astype(float).mean()
print(f"Average surcharge: {avg_surcharge:.2f}%")
```

## 📞 Support & Maintenance

### Common Questions

**Q: How often should I run this?**  
A: Weekly or monthly is sufficient. Carriers update surcharges infrequently.

**Q: How reliable is the FedEx scraper?**  
A: FedEx data is scraped successfully. Tables are in collapsed accordions, which the scraper handles automatically.

**Q: Can I run this on a server?**  
A: Yes! Install Chrome headless and use systemd/cron for scheduling.

**Q: Is this legal?**  
A: Fuel surcharge data is publicly available. For production use, verify ToS compliance.

### Updates

Check for website changes if scraping fails:

1. Examine error screenshots
2. Verify table selectors in scraper code
3. Update wait times if needed
4. Test manually in browser
